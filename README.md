## Loan Approval Machine Learning Model

This repository provides an end-to-end solution for **predicting loan approvals** using machine learning techniques. It includes all necessary code, data, and a pre-trained model to help users understand, run, and build upon the core machine learning pipeline for loan approval prediction.

### Features

- **End-to-End ML Pipeline**: From data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, to evaluation and prediction.
- **Ready-to-Use Dataset**: Includes the `loan_approval_dataset.csv` to quickly get started.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Comes with a pickled model (`loan_approval_model.pkl`) for immediate inference or deployment.
- **Sample Application**: Deploy or test predictions via the provided `app.py` file or interactive Jupyter Notebook.
- **Reproducible Code**: All core logic is available in Python scripts and notebooks.
- **Clear Structure**: Well-organized repository to facilitate learning and further development.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lakshay1509/Loan-approval.git
cd Loan-approval
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the App or Notebook**
    - To try the web app:
